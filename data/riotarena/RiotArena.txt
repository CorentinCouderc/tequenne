Map Type		: Deathmatch 2-4 players
Map description         : A small gothic based arena which has a good mix of open area fire-fight mayham, and close
 			  quarters shotgun to your face type fun.  The architecture has been designed to be
 			  functional, while pleasing to the eye, with a further aim of keeping the frame rate down.

Notes                   : I always wanted to make an arena style map, something that put gameplay first.  Everything
 			  in this map is about the fight.  Oh, this is my first release so please go easy! ;-)

Gameplay                : Bots appear to work well on this map.  They go everywhere and take full advantage of
 			  power-ups.  They are pretty tough too!  I found 1 on 1 quite satisfying, and 4 or more
			  bots is a RIOT!  The lack of the railgun is intentional.  I bloody hate that thing!
  			  Rockets on the other hand...

Thanks to               : Well, iD of course.

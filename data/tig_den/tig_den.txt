info

this map sure has dragged out. Its the longest I 
think I've spent on a map and its so small :]

Started work on Tig's Den sometime in January 2000 and 
went through a lot of changes and tweaks to get to this
point. I also learned a hell of lot about Q3A level 
editing along the way. :] 

after a few chats with Spog and a webpage post I managed 
to increase the framerate by heaps (about 3 to 10 FPS on 
my system). That URL was about hint brushes, understanding 
of the bsp process and making brushes detail;
